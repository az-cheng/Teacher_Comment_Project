      "Lewis has been moderately engaged in class, often voicing the thoughts, and diligently working with others. He also pays poor attention in class, well prepared for each class, and has a good understanding of the topics we are covering. He did a solid job on the first quiz, which covered basic terminology for early Christianity. His first paper, comparing two gospels, did an effective and quite thorough job of drawing out differences. His second paper, on the diversity of early Christianity, used good organization and had a strong focus throughout, but he seemed to have a little confusion on some details. He had 6 tardies, which I consider to be excessive. His current grade is a B. Lewis through the hard work, has set a very solid foundation upon which to build a great future understanding in religion.\n",

      "Brian has been highly engaged in class, always voicing the thoughts, and very diligently working with others. He also pays excellent attention in class, very well prepared for each class, and has a terrific understanding of the topics we are covering. He did a good job on the first quiz, showing a good command of basic terminology for the Christian religion. His first paper, comparing two gospels, did an effective and quite thorough job of drawing out differences. His second paper, on the diversity of early Christianity, used good organization and had a strong focus throughout. His current grade is an A. I have so much respect for the avidity with which he dives into the religion learning, and I hope he'll continue exploring the grand world of Christian Lives.\n",

      "James has been moderately engaged in class, never voicing the thoughts, and rarely working with others. He also pays insufficient attention in class, barely prepared for each class, and has a good understanding of the topics we are covering. He had trouble with the first quiz, which covered basic terminology for early Christianity. I would recommend that he come meet with me if they do not understand a subject. His first paper, comparing two gospels, did an effective and quite thorough job of drawing out differences, though he had some trouble keeping a single, specific focus. His second paper, on the diversity of early Christianity, found and implemented strong evidence into his essay, but it was less focused on the different interpretations of Jesus than it might have. He had 22 tardies, which I consider to be excessive. He still has not turned in the Da Bible assignment. His current grade is a C. I'm disappointed at James's attitude in my class this semester. I believe he could have done better if he put in more work and time.\n",

      "Annie has been adequately engaged in class, often voicing the thoughts, and diligently working with others. She also pays sufficient attention in class, poorly prepared for each class, and has a great understanding of the topics we are covering. She did a good job on the first quiz, showing a good command of basic terminology for the Christian religion. Her first paper, comparing two gospels, used good evidence from reliable sources, though her paper was organized in an unorthodox fashion. Her second paper, on the diversity of early Christianity, used good organization and had a strong focus throughout, but she struggled with the more nuanced subtopics. Her current grade is an A. I have so much respect for the avidity with which she dives into the religion learning, and I hope she'll continue exploring the grand world of Christian Lives.\n",
